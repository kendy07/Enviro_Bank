# Enviro_Bank
Enviro-Bank runs only 2 types of accounts, namely, a savings account, and a current account. Most of the behaviour in these 2 types of accounts is very similar eg. deposit, withdraw, calculate interest, etc. Note, however, that the actual implementation of some of this functionality varies significantly between these 2 types of Accounts. As such, the functionality for these 2 types of accounts must be implemented in 2 different classes: SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount. Note that despite the similarity in some of their functionality, in the real world, there is also lot of functionality between these 2 accounts that are different.
